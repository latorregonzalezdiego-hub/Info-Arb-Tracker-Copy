Among 33 long-term survivors (≥3 years), 82% received liver-directed therapy as first-line treatment. First-line liver-directed therapy showed a 93% disease control rate versus 63% for systemic therapy. PHP recipients achieved 100% disease control when used first-line, with 69% partial response, median overall survival of 37.35 months, and median progression-free survival of 10.28 months. The study suggests combining PHP with immune checkpoint inhibitors may improve outcomes, leveraging PHP for hepatic metastases and ICI for extrahepatic disease. These findings support early integration of Delcath’s HEPZATO KIT and CHEMOSAT as part of multimodal treatment strategies for mUM patients.
","1) Real-world evidence demonstrates PHP’s superior efficacy as first-line liver-directed therapy, supporting early adoption.  
2) Combination of PHP with immune checkpoint inhibitors shows potential for enhanced overall and progression-free survival.  
3) Publication in a peer-reviewed journal enhances scientific credibility and market validation of Delcath’s HEPZATO KIT and CHEMOSAT.  
4) Data reinforces potential expansion of PHP use in multimodal strategies, which may increase clinical adoption and revenue opportunities.
","1) Retrospective study design limits ability to establish causality and may be scrutinized by investors for robustness.  
2) Adoption and reimbursement of PHP may remain limited by regulatory and payer hurdles in broader clinical practice.  
3) Market awareness and physician education are required for first-line PHP integration, representing a potential barrier to rapid uptake.  
4) Efficacy data is specific to metastatic uveal melanoma; applicability to other cancers remains unproven, limiting near-term market expansion.

3) EPS: Q4 2025 EPS: $0.05 vs. $(0.016) in Q4 2024. FY 2025 EPS: $0.087 vs. $0.142 in FY 2024.

Operational Summary
1) CEO Chris Beck highlighted a “resilient rebound in both revenue and profitability” following two years of volatility, with leaders returning to hiring decisions in H2 driving increased activity.
2) Caldwell focused on partner productivity, high-caliber professional hiring, and operational efficiency, while IQTalent improved cost discipline and client engagement, contributing to profitability recovery.
3) Board increased quarterly dividend by 300% to $0.01 per share, payable December 19, 2025, and plans to continue share repurchases under its NCIB to enhance shareholder value.
","1) Significant Q4 revenue growth (+42% YoY) at Caldwell and IQTalent indicates strong market demand recovery and operational leverage.
2) Dividend increase of 300% signals strong cash-flow generation and management confidence in the business outlook.
3) Active share repurchase program suggests management is committed to disciplined capital allocation and shareholder returns.
","1) Full-year EPS decreased compared to FY 2024 ($0.087 vs. $0.142), partially due to one-time gains in the prior year, which may raise concerns about sustainable profitability levels.
2) Operating profit for the full year declined ($3.735 million vs. $7.059 million prior year), reflecting prior-year lease gains that are non-recurring.
3) Other expenses related to management separations and sublease losses indicate some operational restructuring and potential integration risk at IQTalent.

1) Sales: Q3 2025 total company sales of CAD $12.22 million vs. CAD $9.56 million in Q3 2024 (+28%). Growth was driven by strong Canadian pharma sales (+19%), international pharma sales (+94%), and legacy business (+83%), reflecting successful product performance and the recent acquisition of Tibella® / Tibelia®.
2) EBITDA: Q3 2025 EBITDA of CAD $3.63 million vs. CAD $2.86 million in Q3 2024 (+27%)
3) EPS: Q3 2025 EPS of CAD $0.23 vs. CAD $0.19 in Q3 2024 (+19%)

Operational Summary
1) Management highlighted that “each of our three businesses performed well during the quarter,” and maintained EBITDA margin at ~30% despite some gross margin compression from sales mix changes.
2) FeraMAX® and Tibella® / Tibelia® products continue to generate profitable sales growth in Canada and internationally, with Tibella® / Tibelia® performing in line with expectations since acquisition in September 2024.
3) Company remains focused on continued profitable growth and momentum through year-end 2025 and into 2026, supported by NCIB share repurchases (19,500 shares YTD) and regular quarterly dividends.
","1) Strong sales growth across all business units, especially international pharma (+94% Q3) and legacy business (+83%), demonstrating effective commercialization and successful integration of acquired products.
2) Consistent EBITDA margins (~30% in Q3, 29% YTD) despite sales mix changes, showing disciplined cost management.
3) Ongoing shareholder returns through NCIB repurchases and quarterly dividends, indicating confidence in cash flow and financial stability.
","1) Gross margin compression noted due to sales mix changes, which could pressure future profitability if trends continue.
2) Reliance on recent acquisitions like Tibella® / Tibelia® for incremental growth, which introduces integration and execution risk.
3) International sales, while high-growth percentage-wise, are small in absolute terms (CAD $1.15 million in Q3), making them sensitive to market or regulatory fluctuations.

6,CVE:TMG,Industrial Machinery,11/20/2025,Thermal Energy International Inc. Receives an Additional $1.6 Million Order to Deliver Customized HeatSponge Heat Recovery Units to the Arctic,Contract Award,CAD,21,-3,18,171,0.12,28,0.00,N/A,N/A,0.6x,N/A,N/A,N/A,"1) Thermal Energy International received a $1.6M order for eight custom HeatSponge heat recovery units for an Arctic mining operation, following a prior $400k order for two units, highlighting repeat business with a strategic customer.  
2) CEO William Crossland emphasized the technical complexity of the project, stating the units are engineered to handle extreme reciprocating engine conditions with high heat, pressure, and vibration, where previous heat exchangers were failing.  
3) BEI President Vincent Sands noted the project demonstrates the company's commitment to solving complex energy challenges in extreme environments, emphasizing resilience and sustainability.  
4) The project uses modular, match-marked components for transport by standard cargo aircraft and plug-and-play assembly on-site, enabling rapid installation without specialized contractors, while delivering a 22% efficiency boost and durable, leak-proof design tailored to site constraints.  
","1) Repeat order from the same Arctic mining customer indicates strong client trust and potential for ongoing strategic contracts.  
2) Innovative modular and plug-and-play design enhances operational scalability and positions the company as a problem solver in extreme environments.  
3) 22% efficiency boost and durable design may strengthen Thermal Energy's reputation for technically advanced, high-value solutions.  
","1) Project execution is logistically challenging due to Arctic access constraints, with potential delays if transport or on-site assembly issues arise.  
2) Installation must occur within narrow windows, increasing operational risk and reliance on client staff without specialized support.  
3) Dependence on a single large customer for a high-value order may expose the company to concentration risk.

6,TSE:WELL,Medical/Nursing Services,11/20/2025,"WELL Health Reports Strong Organic Growth, Major Advances in Clinic Digitization, and Rapid Progress on New Primary Care Patient Openings",Corporate Update,CAD,993,542,"1,534",254,3.91,"1,233",-0.08,0.08,0.35,1.2x,N/A,48.9x,11.2x,"1) WELL reported that same-clinic organic growth reached 10% in primary care and 16% in diagnostics, with absorption growth contributing additional uplift, and the company highlighted new enhanced disclosure showing how organic growth is being generated across WMC and WDC.
2) Management disclosed that 92% of clinics older than nine months have achieved ""core digitization"" — defined by four usage-based digital workflows — and stated that the goal is for every clinic to hit this standard within one year, with the definition likely expanding as AI tools roll out.
3) WELL said it created over 45,000 new primary care patient openings across three provinces and has already filled 25,000 as of Oct. 31, expecting to fill the remainder by end of Q1 2026, supported by physician recruitment, centralized marketing, and digital intake systems designed to accelerate roster building.
","1) The company is achieving high (92%) penetration of core digitization across eligible clinics, indicating strong adoption of digital workflows and a scalable operational model.
2) Rapid filling of new patient openings (25k already filled) suggests strong demand, effective marketing, and successful physician recruitment — all pointing to continued network expansion.
3) Management’s plan to expand the definition of “core digitization” with new AI tools (AI Ambient Scribe, AI Decision Support) signals ongoing operational leverage and potential future efficiency gains.
","1) Absorption-driven growth at WMC is only 6%, which may indicate slower-than-expected ramping of newly added clinics or limited capacity uplift.
2) The company implies that full digitization is not yet uniform across all clinics and still requires a 12-month ramp, creating operational variability and potential integration friction as more clinics join.
3) Heavy dependence on centralized marketing and support infrastructure for physician roster building highlights a structural risk — independent physician practices may not scale efficiently without WELL’s continuous intervention.

6,NIXX,Personnel Services,11/21/2025,"Nixxy Inc. Announces its AI-powered Sales Acceleration Platform, Leadnova.ai Enters User Acceptance Testing, Targeting Commercial Beta Launch in Q1 2026",New Product/Service,USD,27,0,27,25,1.10,47,-0.44,N/A,N/A,0.6x,N/A,N/A,N/A,"1) Leadnova.ai has entered User Acceptance Testing, with management targeting a commercial beta launch in Q1 2026 as part of Nixxy’s broader push into the AI data market and future data monetization opportunities.  
2) CEO Mike Schmidt said the goal since acquiring the assets in Q2 2025 has been to “rapidly evolve them into a market-ready AI data product” that becomes the center of Nixxy’s ecosystem and positions the company to compete in AI-powered, data-driven customer acquisition.  
3) Management emphasized that Leadnova.ai serves as “the front door into Nixxy's AI data strategy,” enabling future opportunities such as enterprise data licensing and tokenized, data-backed value models while consolidating multiple sales outreach tools into one platform for SMBs and agencies.  
","1) Leadnova entering UAT with a defined Q1 2026 commercial beta timeline signals execution progress and a near-term catalyst.  
2) Management frames Leadnova as core to its AI data strategy, indicating potential high strategic value and optionality (data licensing, tokenized data models).  
3) The platform consolidates multiple sales/outreach tools into a single system, positioning it favorably for budget-constrained SMBs and agencies — a large, high-churn market hungry for efficiency.  
","1) Heavy dependence on integrating multiple acquired AI assets suggests execution risk, especially given the company’s rapid M&A pace in 2025.  
2) The product aims to compete in an extremely crowded AI sales automation market, raising differentiation and adoption risks despite large data access claims.  
3) No mention of existing pilot customers or committed demand means early traction remains unproven heading into UAT.

6,NTWK,Information Technology Services,11/21/2025,NETSOL’s Transcend Retail signs two US dealer groups,Contract Award,USD,36,-14,22,12,3.01,67,0.05,N/A,N/A,0.3x,60.2x,N/A,N/A,"1) Porsche North Houston and Jim Shorkey Nissan both deployed Transcend Retail, with Porsche completing implementation in under five weeks and five additional Porsche stores scheduled to go live by December 1, 2025.  
2) Management highlighted measurable improvements: Porsche North Houston reported “a huge influx of leads,” higher client engagement, and superior UX versus prior tools; Jim Shorkey Nissan emphasized ease of use, transparency, and strong vendor support from NETSOL.  
3) NETSOL framed these deployments as strategic momentum in North America, positioning Transcend Retail as a “modern and intelligent” platform designed to reduce friction, modernize the sales funnel, and drive back-end finance and service revenue across large dealer groups.  
","1) Rapid expansion pipeline: five additional Porsche dealerships are already scheduled to go live by December 1, signaling strong customer validation and near-term deployment momentum.  
2) Dealers are reporting operational uplift — including increased lead flow, higher engagement, and a smoother customer journey — which strengthens NETSOL’s competitive positioning.  
3) Management explicitly frames Transcend Retail as a strategic growth engine in North America, suggesting continued dealer adoption and deeper penetration into large auto groups.  
","1) No quantitative KPIs were provided to validate claims of lead increases or engagement improvements, making operational gains hard to size.  
2) Heavy reliance on customer testimonials may indicate early-stage traction still being proved out rather than established market dominance.  
3) The PR does not clarify integration challenges, onboarding costs, or scalability constraints as deployments ramp across multiple dealer groups.
